This repository contains the source code for the paper **Demo2Test: Transfer Testing of Adversarial Agent from Failure Demonstrations**.

# Overview

We propose Demo2Test for conducting transfer testing of adversarial agents in competitive games, i.e., leveraging the demonstrations of failure scenarios from the source task to boost the testing effectiveness in the target task.

Experimental evaluation on effectiveness of Demo2Test  on four transfer settings in the competitive game environment of MuJoCo with promising performance, outperforming four baselines.

The overview of Demo2Test is shown in the figure below:
